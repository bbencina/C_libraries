# C_libraries

Wanting to renew my knowledge of the C programming language I thought writing a couple of data structures and algorithms would be a good start.

This repository for now contains only a LinkedList library with a couple of related data structures as well as a library of scientific and mathematical constants which of course direly needs an upgrade.

More will come, algorithms with them and whatever random concept that comes to mind.

I also know the naming of functions in the LinkedList library is not standard, but that is how I wanted to try and do it. Will maybe fix later.
